                Bethany began school at the age of 6. She was homeschooled through Our Lady of Faith
                Catholic Homeschool from Kindergarten through Fourth Grade. After a brief stint in 
                public school, she returned to Our Lady of Faith from Seventh Grade until her
                graduation from High School.

            <blockquote>
                I really loved being homeschooled. In public school a lot of the teachers don't care 
                about you, and the kids can be really cruel. Plus, if you fall behind, it is hard to
                catch up. In Homeschool, you can stay on a topic until you master it. Plus the other 
                kids I've met in the Homeschool community are really nice. - Bethany Tarvin
